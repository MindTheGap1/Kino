    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2> What is Kino? </h2>
    <p> Kino is a movie rental website where you can rent the newest movies for a limited amount of time of your choice! No need for a subscription! </p>
    <br>
    <h2> When does my rental period begin? </h2>
    <p> The rental period of purchased movies begins as soon as you press the play button. You can check how long is left of your rental in the "My Collection" page. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> What happens when my rental period ends? </h2>
    <p> Once the rental period is over, you will no longer have access to the movie that you have rented unless you rent it again. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Can I extend my rental period? </h2>
    <p> We cannot extend your period currently but your progress is saved even if you are not currently renting the movie so you can rent it again. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Can I purchase a movie to keep? </h2>
    <p> Unfortunately we do not sell the movies, only limited time rentals. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> If I close my tab, will my progress into the movie be lost? </h2>
    <p> No! We keep track of where you are in each movie so you can jump back right where you left off, anytime and anywhere! </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Can I see which movies I have previously rented? </h2>
    <p> Yes, in the "My Account" page you can find information regarding previous and current orders. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Can anyone else see my ratings? </h2>
    <p> No other users will be able to see what you have rated personally but your rating will be used to update the average rating of the movie. </p>
